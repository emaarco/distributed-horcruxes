# üìò Detailed Challenges in Process Automation with Zeebe

When working with external systems like Zeebe, distributed transactions can lead to several challenges. Here's a
detailed breakdown of the most common issues and their impacts, along with examples, diagrams, and an architectural
perspective to provide additional context.

## **Example Process: Newsletter Subscription** üìß

To understand the challenges, let‚Äôs use an example: a **newsletter subscription process**. This process involves the
following steps:

1. A user submits a subscription form.
2. The system saves the subscription data in a database.
3. The system notifies Zeebe to handle the process, triggering tasks like sending a confirmation email and updating
   subscription status.

Here‚Äôs the process diagram:

## **Architecture Overview** üèóÔ∏è

The newsletter subscription process is implemented in a **hexagonal architecture**. Transactions are defined at the *
*service level**, which interacts with the database and the external process engine (Zeebe) through well-defined ports.

The architecture ensures clear separation of concerns but introduces challenges when the database and the process engine
need to remain synchronized.

### **Architecture Diagram**:

### **How It Works**:

1. **Service Layer**: Contains the business logic and transaction handling.
2. **Database**: Stores subscription data.
3. **Process Engine**: Orchestrates tasks like sending emails and updating subscription statuses.

Here‚Äôs an example of how the service might look:

```kotlin
@Service
@Transactional
class SubscribeToNewsletterService(
    private val repository: NewsletterSubscriptionRepository,
    private val processPort: NewsletterSubscriptionProcess
) {
    override fun subscribe(command: SubscribeToNewsletterUseCase.Command): SubscriptionId {
        val subscription = buildSubscription(command)
        repository.save(subscription)
        processPort.submitForm(subscription.id)
        return subscription.id
    }
}
```

In this setup:

- The service saves subscription data to the database.
- It immediately notifies the process engine (via `submitForm`) to start the workflow.

However, this approach can lead to several challenges when database transactions and engine interactions are not
properly synchronized.

## **Challenges**

### **1. Premature Execution üö®**

The process engine starts tasks **before your database transaction is committed**, causing tasks to rely on uncommitted
or incomplete data.

- **Example**: After submitting the subscription form, the engine starts a task to send a confirmation email. However,
  if the database transaction fails, the email task cannot find the subscription data.
- **Impact**: Tasks fail unexpectedly, requiring retries or manual intervention to recover.

#### **Process Flow**:

    participant User
    participant Engine
    participant Worker
    participant Controller
    participant Service
    participant DB
    User ->> Controller: 1. subscribe
    Controller ->> Service: 2. create subscription
    Service ->> Engine: 3. start process
    Service ->> DB: 4. commit transaction
    Worker ->> Engine: 5. get job
    Worker ->> Service: 6. send confirmation
    Service ->> DB: 7. load subscription
```

### **2. Out-of-Sync States: Engine Ahead of Service üîÑ**

If the database transaction fails **after notifying Zeebe**, the engine continues executing tasks with outdated data.

- **Example**: A user confirms their subscription, triggering an update in the database and notifying Zeebe. If the
  database update fails, the engine still proceeds as though the subscription was updated.
- **Impact**: Zeebe's state advances while the database remains unchanged, creating inconsistencies.

### **3. Out-of-Sync States: Conflicting Data üîÅ**

Tasks in the engine may start out of order, leading to overwrites or even deadlocks.

- **Example**: The process involves confirming a subscription and then sending a welcome email. If the email task
  executes before the confirmation task finishes, database updates may happen in the wrong order.
- **Impact**: Out-of-order tasks cause data conflicts or deadlocks, requiring manual fixes or complex rollback
  mechanisms.

### **4. Retry Behavior and Duplicate Calls üîÅ**

Distributed systems often retry failed tasks, but retries can result in duplicate operations if not handled properly.

- **Example**: A service retries sending a message to Zeebe due to a database timeout. Each retry generates duplicate
  messages in the engine.
- **Impact**: Duplicates create unnecessary operations, affecting system performance and reliability.

### **5. Job Completion Failure: Network Issues üåê**

Even if the worker completes a task successfully, network issues may prevent it from notifying Zeebe.

- **Example**: A worker sends a confirmation email but cannot mark the job as complete due to a network failure.
- **Impact**: The database is updated, but Zeebe's state remains incomplete, requiring manual intervention to sync
  states.

#### **Job Completion Flow**:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Engine
    participant Worker
    participant Controller
    participant Service
    participant DB
    Worker ->> Engine: 1. get job
    Worker ->> Service: 2. send confirmation
    Service ->> DB: 3. load subscription
    Service ->> Service: 4. Update subscription
    Service ->> DB: 5. Save & commit subscription
    Service ->> Worker: 6. return result
    Worker ->> Engine: 7. complete job
```

### **6. Job Completion Failure: Task No Longer Available ‚è≥**

A worker might complete a task after the engine has already canceled or invalidated it due to timers, cancellations, or
other intermediate events.

- **Example**: A worker updates a subscription, but a timer cancels the workflow before the task finishes.
- **Impact**: The worker's changes are unnecessary, creating mismatches and requiring rollback or compensating actions.
